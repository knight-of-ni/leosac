@page page_guide_install_from_package Build and install Debian package

@brief Describe how to build and install a Leosac deb package.

Target platform
---------------

This guide is intended to be used on Debian Stretch with amd64 architecture or Raspbian Stretch with armv6/armv7 architecture.

Dependencies
------------

For starters, install these packages:
  + `apt-get install cmake build-essential git sudo devscripts`

There is a bug in the ODB compiler found in the Debian and Raspbian repos, which prevents Leosac from building.
A bug report has been filed. See [#889664](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=889664).
Until this has been resolved and new pacakges are pushed out to the Debian and Raspbian repos, one must use the odb packages in the Leosac bin-resources repo instead.

The following steps were performed on a Raspberry PI running Stretch with gcc 6.4 installed.
The folder you choose may differ from this example. Choose the appropriate subfolder names which match your architecture and version of gcc.
  + `git clone https://github.com/leosac/bin-resources`
  + `cd bin-resources/debian/gcc6/armhf`
  + `sudo dpkg -i *.deb`

There are additional dependencies required to build Leosac, but those will be installed for you by the deb.sh script.

Build
-----

Get the Leosac Debian packaging script and mark it executable:
  + `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leosac/leosac/develop/deb.sh`
  + `chmod +x deb.sh`

If you intend to build the very latest code from the develop branch, then simply call deb.sh with no parameters to start the build process:
  + `./deb.sh`

If instead you prefer to build the latest release (or some other branch), then use the -b flag to specify the branch, tag, or release to build:
  + `./deb.sh -b v0.7.0`

Replace "v0.70" with the tag name of the most recent release, found on the leosac [releases page](https://github.com/leosac/leosac/releases).

That's it!
When the build completes, it will present the name of the folder, under /tmp, where the newly built package files reside.
From the command line, navigate to that folder and install the Leosac debian package file using dpkg -i or gdebi.
